			Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of cl
			assical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin pr
			ofessor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consec
			tetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, 
			discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus
			 Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a trea
			 tise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line 
			of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</strong></em></pre>
